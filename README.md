#### Description:
RPlat2D is a simple 2d platformer made in unity i made this project to
teach myself game developement in unity and i didnt make a very complex project for cs50 
due to not having time but overall im proud of how the game came out to be, Also a disclaimer. 
All the 2d art wasnt made by me i downloaded an asset that had all the art so i can make the levels and the player
so if your wondering what asset i used its called: Pixel Adventure 1. And you can find it in the unity asset store.
Anyways this was my final project for cs50!.
